# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> I "learned" to use the library by thoroughly reading the API's README file. It was very thorough and helpful, which explained most all of the program's method functionalities. When learning to write the examples, I learned this through trial and error mostly as I was initially clueless about how to write an example. I used the prompt repository to get a rough idea of where to start, although I still struggled a lot. One aspect of the module's code that was easy to understand was the isQuoted function, because that was a basic if statement that returned a boolean value of if the string was wrapped in quotes. One change that would have made it easier would have been clearly clarifying in the main .js file which functions are public (maybe they even did this, I just couldn't find it).


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> I would say that "raise the level of abstraction" just means simplifying what is happening in the code in Layman's terms - explaining the high-level purpose of the pertinent program funcitons. I would advise a new CS142 student to write comments as if they're explaining them to a brand new student who has not programmed before (the comments should not require programming knowledge, besides maybe the extreme basics).


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> It took me approximately 8 hours to complete this assignment. Most of the difficulty was encountered when checking the test cases.


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> Ryan Budnik and I both chose the ini program from the assignment so that we could talk about the high-level functionality of the different methods. We then later conferred on parts of the program that we could not figure out to help each other determine functionality.


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> Running examples of the test cases was difficult at first, as this was a completely new JavaScript challenge to me. The prompt repository examples were hard to me to understand... more information around these examples may have been helpful. Eventually it turned out to be really straightforward, although it took me a while to get to that level of understanding.
